- This dataset contains tumor volumes for 248 unique mice (50.4% Male / 49.6% Female) were treated with 10 different
 drug regimens. Mean and median tumor volumes were calculated for each regimen and distribution values were provided.
 Most regimens showed tumor volumes averaging 52-55 mm3. Capomulin and Ramicane regimens showed decreased average tumor 
 volumes with average volumes of approximately 40 mm3. Mice treated with these regimens were observed for longer timespans, 
 indicating prolonged life. A linear decrease in tumor volume can be observed more these mice, as evidence by the line graph 
 of mouse b128 provided. Both Ramican and Capomulin performed statistically similar, though Ramicane provided slightly lower 
 median and mean tumor volumes. Capomulin interestingly had a slightly tighter inner quartile range. It also appeared that 
 lower weight mice saw improved tumor weight reduction, with the correlation coefficient between the average tumor volume and 
 mouse weight being 0.84 for mice treated with Capomulin, indiciating a strong correlation.
